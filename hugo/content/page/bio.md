I received a BA in Psychology, with a minor in Studio Art, from Transylvania University located in Lexington, KY, and a MS in Community Counseling from Austin Peay State University in Clarkesville, TN. I then went on to earn a PhD in Counseling Psychology from The University of Memphis, where I acquired additional clinical training in process-experiential methods, and concentrations in qualitative inquiry and social justice. I interned at the University of Florida Counseling and Wellness Center and have since been working in private practice in Richmond, VA. My PhD and internship programs are accredited by the American Psychological Association. I have been licensed in Virginia as a Clinical Psychologist since 2013.
